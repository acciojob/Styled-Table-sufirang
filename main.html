    <!-- add table here -->
<p>You are given a non-decreasing array A of N integers. You are given another integer target.</p>

<p>You have to find two unique indices of the array such that the values at those indices have a sum equal to target.</p>

<p>Return the indices as a sorted integer array of size 2.</p>

<p>It is guaranteed that the test cases are made such that only one solution exists.</p>

<p>The array is 1-indexed.</p>

<p>Note Complete the given function. The input and output would be handled by the driver code.</p>

<p>Your solution must use only constant extra space.</p>

<p><strong>Input Format</strong></p>

<p>The first line contains a single integer N.</p>

<p>The second line contains N space-separated integers of array A.</p>

<p>The third line contains a single integer target.</p>
